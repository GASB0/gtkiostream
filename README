[Support this project by purchasing our hardware.](http://www.audioinjector.net/)

Trivialised Threading, GTK GUIs, Signal Processing, Neural Networks, Audio Processing, Octave interfacing ... and more !

= Description =

Create GTK+ interfaces using IOStream style code.
Its simple and quick!

Also providing simple data plotting (similar to Matlab/Octave), ORB (Object Request Broker), and Neural Network computations.

You can create GTK+ GUIs in a few lines of code.

Labels<<"Thanks for reading";
(HBox<<Labels).show();

or even one line :
(HBox() << (Labels()<<"Thanks for reading")).show();

Inline code destructs the classes, but leaves the widgets/callbacks operating. This is great for embedded memory saving code.

You can also plot like so :
Plot figure; figure.plot(x, y, x.size());

= Some only depend on headers =

If you just want to use GTK GUI stuff, then no need to build the project, simply include the header files in your project.

If you want to make and install, then like so :

install some prerequisites : g++ automake libtool pkg-config
./configure
make
make install

If you wish to start, try this :
g++ `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0` LabelsTest.C -o LabelsTest `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0`
./LabelsTest

For Unix/Linux etc. Users :

Run the auto conf script :
./tools/autotools.sh

Run configure  : ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
Run make : make
Run make install : make install

That should install it in a suitable directory.
