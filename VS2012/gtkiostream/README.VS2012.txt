This project was built using visual studio 2010.

To use the GUI building header files, grab the libraries from www.gtk.org, currently tested using version 2.24.
Extract to c:\gtk+
Add c:\gtk+\bin to your PATH variable.

Further to build libgtkiostream you will need the sox and octave software installed.

You will need the eigen headers :
